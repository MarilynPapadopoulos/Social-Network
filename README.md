# Social-Network

## Description 

This is a social network app that creates a user and allows that user to add thoughts and friends.  Friends may add replies to the thoughts posted by the user.  The purpose of this assignment is for a social media start up to be able to store unstructed data.  

## Technology Used
* Mongodb
* Mongoose

To start this app enter npm start from the command line to connect to the server.  I used Insomnia Core to access all the routes.
